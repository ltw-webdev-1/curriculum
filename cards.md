markbot_notes: |
  We don’t have an `<h1>` in this code because I feel like these cards are part of a larger website so the `<h1>` would probably be somewhere else on the page.

goal:
  before: "We’re going to walk through writing some HTML and CSS to generate an informational layout."
  notes:
    - label: "Type it, type it real good"
      text: "Remember the purpose of this lesson is to type the code out yourself—build up that muscle memory in your fingers!"

steps:
  - title: "Set up the project"
    before: |
      After cloning the repo to your computer we need to create the default files.
    folders:
      - label: "cards"
        type: folder
      - label: "index.html"
        indent: 1
      - label: "css"
        type: folder
        indent: 1
      - label: "main.css"
        indent: 2
    after: |
      1. Make a new `index.html` file in your `cards` folder.
      2. Make a folder named `css` in your `cards` folder.
      3. Make a new `main.css` in your `css` folder.
    notes:
      - label: "Naming conventions"
        text: "Don’t forget to follow the [naming conventions](/topics/naming-paths-cheat-sheet/#naming-conventions)."

  - title: "Add HTML boilerplate"
    before: "*Use the `html5`, `viewport` and `css` snippets.*"

    notes:

        text: "Create the boilerplate with `borderbox`"
    after: "The `border-box` system changes the browsers layout math to include the `padding` in the `width`—the default is more difficult to manage when making flexible, responsive websites."

  - title: "Write the card HTML"
    before: |
      For the cards, an unordered list makes sense because the website is a list of space probes.

      Next up we’ll style the card itself by adding some colours, borders, and sizes.

      - num: 14
        text: |
          The `margin` property adds space **outside** of the box.

          This `margin` is composed of four values:

          1. top
          2. right
          3. bottom
          4. left

          Start at the top and work clockwise around the box.
      - num: 15

      - num: 16
        text: |
          The `padding` property will add spacing **inside** the box.

          Padding can have four values like margin or only one value that will affect all four sides. (Margin does this too.)
      - num: 18
        text: |
          The `border` property allows us to add a stroke around the outside of a box.

          Borders require three pieces of information:

          1. The thickness, usually in pixels.
          2. The style: `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, etc.
          3. The border’s colour.
      - num: 19
        text: "The `border-radius` property allows us to round the corners of a box."

      *This is what you should see in your browser when the window’s width is small:*

      ![](card-s.jpg)

      *And when the width is a little wider:*

      ![](card-l.jpg)

      **Notice how we’re taking advantage of the browser’s flow:**

      - When there isn’t enough space the boxes stack on top of each other.
      - When there is enough space they fit beside each other on the same line.

      *This is because we’re using `display: inline-block` on the `<li>` tags.*

  - title: "Centering the boxes"
    before: |
      It would look a little better if the boxes were centred on the screen instead of flush-left.

        fade: true
      - num: 10
        text: |
          Because the `<li>` tags are `inline-block` we can use `text-align: center`, which works on all `inline` and `inline-block` elements.

          **We need to put `text-align: center` on a parent element so that it affects all of its children.**
      - num: "15-16"
        fade: true
      - num: 17
        text: "Because we set everything inside `.cards` to be centred that would affect all the text too, but we only want to center the boxes not the text—so we have to reset the interior of the boxes to `text-align: left`"

  - title: "Style the image and text"

      Let’s concentrate on the inside of the boxes by styling the small image and some of the text.

      - num: 9

          The image will look better centred, but because the image is `block` `text-align: center` no longer works. Instead we can use automatic left and right margins.

          - We can’t use `auto` margins because that only works on `display: block` elements, and we don’t want the link to stretch all the way across.
